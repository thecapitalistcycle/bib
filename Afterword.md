Isaac Ilyich Rubin-History of Economic Thought  -Ink Links (1979).pdf

This is an important and unparalleled work which situated Marx's economic theory in relation to the economic theories that pre-date him - from mercantilism to John Stuart Mill. First published in 1929, the book dates from the fertile period of Marxist economic theory that produced the works of Preobrazhensky, Kondratiev and Bukharin. However as a review of pre-Marxist economics it stands out from the many books which dwell only on the contemporary industrialisation debates. This is a selective reading of economic thought, offering analysis of those elements in past economics that accord with the areas of interest to Marxism. Each section gives a brief analysis of a specific school of thought, with particular attention to the social and ideological climate within which it evolved. The book differs from orthodox accounts in not merely mentioning historical background but using it as a central explanation of the evolution of economic theories. As a counterpoint to Rubin, Catherine Colliot-Thelene has written a daring essay which locates a crucial flaw in the logical structure of Marx's Capital.

## 4 What is at Stake in the 'Critique' of Political Economy

Marx has very clearly designated the absence of a historical perspective
in the writings of bourgeois economists as the most fundamental cause
of numerous registrable errors or lacunae in their doctrines The
critique of political economy, his real ambition, was to restore to
economic systems the historicity that conventional economic doc-
trines had deprived them of. In the mind of its author, this critique
had two distinct aspects First of all, it was to disclose the tacit
presuppositions on which the economic theories were built, that is, to
show that these theories did not, as they claimed, study economic
rationality in general, but the modes of regulation peculiar to a parti-
cular form of production and exchange, resting on specific relations of

[p416]

production, namely commodity relations between private owners But
Marx further assumed that once he had brought to light the specificity,
of the conditions for commodity production, he could show that the
laws of internal regulation of that mode of production provide the
basis for a particular form of development This development cannot
be expected to be a smooth, indefinitely renewed reproduction of the
same system (even on an enlarged basis); it has, on the contrary, to
unfold in a chaotic way—disequilibrium being as much a part of its
essence as equilibrium—and it has to carry within it the germs of an
ineluctable final destructuration [^11] The reproduction of the capital-
ist mode of production—as the developed form of commodity produc-
tion—was to be viewed as a necessarily disturbed process jeopardized
in the more or less long term by the fractures inscribed in its intrinsic
order.

[p417]

Historical considerations ate thus summoned to buttress economic
study. They feature at the beginning of the study, in as much as
straight away the mode of production is studied in history and
emphasis is placed on its distinguishing characteristics; they arise,
spontaneously at the end of the study, once the law of development
inherent in the mode of production has been mastered There is,
however, continuity in this study, for the distinctive forms of a mode
of organization of production and exchange essentially merge with the
laws presiding over its development and its final transformation It is
significant in this respect that Marx links the refusal of bourgeois
economists (Ricardo in particular) to accept the possibility of general
crises to their failure to recognize the specificity of capitalist produc-
tion [^12] This implies that, conversely, the reformulation of the law of
value on the basis of a correct understanding of its historical signifi-
cance must lead to an opposite conclusion, namely one which would
show that the phenomenon of crises, and the general crisis of produc-
tion in particular, is the inevitable manifestation of an, as it were,
genetic defect in the system of production founded on this law Thus
the deductive chain from the formulation of the concept of value to a
highlighting of the conditions wherein the system would become
destructuted ought to feed itself out in an unbroken series of links

The first aspect of the critical task was satisfactorily realized in the
theory of fetishism It has not been so with the second Marx never got
to the bottom of his theory of crises No doubt a remark as peremptory


[p418]

as that will meet with many a Marxist economist ready to contradict it
The majority are agreed that the theory of crises is incomplete in
Capital but many nonetheless hold it to be a solid basis for further
elaboration We, however, think that the constitutive hypotheses of
Capital are an obstacle to that It is out of the question to entertain the
idea that within the limited framework of this Afterword we could
tackle the various theses held on this matter and anticipate all the
possible objections to out own position We shall restrict ourselves to
indicating

** start here?**

[p418]...

... We shall restrict ourselves to
indicating the decisive problem that is, in our view, the inevitable
stumbling block for all attempts to provide a sequel to _Capital_ which
would seek to bridge the gulf between the abstract plan within which
its analyses are deployed and the study of concrete conjunctures.
It is true that, in _Grundrisse_[^13] just as much as in _Capital_ or TSV,
we find the scattered elements of a study of crises Part II of TSV even
provides us with a synthesis which is sufficiently complete for us to be
able to rely on it entirely Among others, two successive stages in thrs
study are distinguished, as was already the case in *Capital* (*Capital*, I,
p 145 ) The first consists in disclosing, step by step with the increase
in understanding of the regularities peculiar to the capitalist system of
production, the forms in which the *possibility* of disfunctionings is
already inscribed This amounts to showing how the potentiality of
crises is given in the very formulation of the conditions of regulation of
the system. This first stage is in its turn separated into different
moments ordered according to a principle of increasing concretization
Thus, the following are noted as so many abstract—though to differ­
ent degrees—forms of possibility of crisis: 1), the separation of sale

[p419]

and purchase; 2), the function of money as means of payment; and 3),
. the autonomization of the phase of circulation in relation to the phase
of production of capital.

But, and this is crucial, for Marx this first stage is insufficient It
needs to be completed by an analysis of the reality of crises, that is, of
the conditions which turn a potential crisis into an actual one (TSV II
p. 515 ) Indeed, so long as one restricts oneself to noting the elements
which render crises possible, and nothing more, bourgeois economists
can continue to give vent to their optimism, since the actuality of crises
retains a contingent character Recognition of the fact that crisis is
possible, in so far as reflection stops there, can be rightly considered a
fall-back line for bourgeois economists, already convinced that it
would be naive to deny any longer the existence of economic crises
'This shows how insipid the economists are who, when they are no
longer able to explain away the phenomenon of over-production and
crises, are content to say that these forms contain the possibility of
crises, that it is therefore accidental whether or not crises occur and
consequently their occurrence is itself merely a matter of chance '
(TSV Hp 512)

This second stage in the study of crises remained but a draft project
in Marx's^texts We shall be told, no doubt, that this can be attributed
to the unfinished nature of the work. And we can envisage filling this
gap by combining the study of the forms of possibility of crises and the
problem of the realization of surplus value, or the law of the tendency
of the rate of profit to decline To estimate such a project's chances of
success, it is instructive to remember at what moment in the plan of
his work Marx had postponed taking up the reality of crises It is in the
section on competition and credit, in which 'the real movement of
capitalist production' is finally to be tackled, that the elements needed
for this study were to be pieced together ' . the real crisis can only be
educed from the real movement of capitalist production, competition
and credit ' (TSV II p, 512 ) And: 'In so far as crises arise from
changes in prices and revolutions in prices which do not coincide with
changes in the values of commodities, they naturally cannot be
investigated during the examination of capital in general, in which the
prices of commodities are assumed to be identical with the values of
commodities ' (TSV Hp 515 ) We know that the plan of the work has
undergone a number of modifications in the course of its writing
which was long and laborious What has become of the section on
competition in the final draft of this plan? Rosdolsky has a detailed
discussion of this question in his exegetical work devoted to Grundrisse
He reaches a conclusion which in our view is a convincing one, namely
that at the time Marx was writing Capital, in particular Volume III, he

[p420]

had abandoned the main distinction he established in the > 1-857
Introduction between the analysis of 'capital in general' and that of
competition (Rosdolsky 19681, p 36 and p 36 n 35.) A large part of
the themes formerly ranged under this second heading had been
absorbed into the analysis of 'capital in general' Qnly a few specific
problems, among them the 'real movement of market prices', were
postponed in this* way to a possible future study of competition But
Marx did not consider the necessity of that study crucial to his work.
'The actual movement of competition belongs beyond our scope, and
we need present only the inner organization of the capitalist mode of
production, in its ideal average, as it were ' (Capital, III, p 831.) It is
possible, nonetheless, to concede that Marx confined his initial
ambitions and circumscribed his work to the study of 'capital in
general' alone, appending to it some themes which did not originally
belong to that study It is also possible to maintain at the same time
that there is nothing to stop us effecting the study of the 'real move-
ment of market prices' which on Marx's own recognition is indispen-
sable to a complete understanding of the phenomena of crises But
that is exactly where the difficulty lies. Is it possible, on the basis of the
Marxian theory of value or of costs of production, to construct a new
stage which includes a theory of prices? Or, to formulate it differently,
can the process of concretization alluded to in particular at the
beginning of Volume III of Capital (a process which is brought close to
us 'step by step' under the form which it assumes 'on the surface of
society, in the action of different capitals upon one another, in com-
petition, and in the ordinary consciousness of the agents of produc-
tion themselves'), (Capital, III, p 25) can this process be pursued
without any break, by adding new parameters and come to explain the
causes of price movements? We must look at what those authors who
put forward the methodological particularities of the Marxian
approach (we mean here 'the method of rising from the abstract to the
concrete' (18.57 Introduction, p 101)) have in mind when they invoke
the new parameters to be taken into considerarion for dealing wrth the
problem of market prices at an opportune time Quite simply, com--
petition, and particularly its effects: constant fluctuations in the
relation of supply to demand. They take it as given'that the study of
'capital in general' presupposes that fluctuations in supply and
demand are bracketed off, as it were—a legitimate theoretical abstrac-
tion as a first step, but one that must necessarily be abandoned later .
On this point, they have plenty of quotations from Marx to draw on to
guarantee the orthodoxy of their interpretation Thus, in Chapter X of
Capital Volume III, which is fundamental for the study of this
question, Marx reasserts his long held conviction that it is impossible

[p421]

to explain the laws of capitalist production by means of the inter-
action of supply and demand. He then states the thesis which is ordi-
narily taken to be the key to his methodology; 'these laws cannot be
observed in their pure state, until supply and demand cease to act,
i.e , are equated In reality, supply and demand never coincide .
But political economy assumes that supply and demand coincide with
one another. Why? To be able to study phenomena in their funda-
mental relations, in the form corresponding to their conception, that
is, is to study them independently of the appearances caused by the
movement of supply and demand The other reason is to find the
actual tendencies of their movements and to some extent to record
them .' (Capital, III, pp 189-90, our emphasis )[^14] Here the cause
seems to be understood The study of 'capital in general', that is, of
the laws governing, the functioning and the development of the
capitalist mode of production, requires that the effects of the supply/
demand relation be conceptually suspended, since these effects per-
tain to deceptive appearance into the trap of which vulgar economists
can be so easily led If, bearing in mind the critical objectives of the
Marxian theory, we ponder over this statement we can easily see that it
raises a considerable difficulty The analysis of 'capital in general', 'in
its ideal average', assumes an identity between the values and prices of
commodities, the sale of commodities at their value, or, in a more
complex schema, at their costs of production, and this constitutes a
sufficient condition for assuring the equilibrium of the system of
production As soon as we shelve the factors of disequilibrium (con-
stant discrepancy between supply and demand 01, what is the same
thing, divergence between price and value) into the realm of 'appear-
ances', isn't the project which claims to demonstrate the essential
purtenance of disequilibriums to this system of production con-
demned to failure right from the start? But in our view, there is an
even more fundamental difficulty While both Ricardo and Marx saw
the deviations in the relation of price to value as the effect of the
supply/demand relation, Marx, unlike his predecessor, has constantly
stressed that those deviations are not accidents or elements disturbing
the normal state of equilibrium, but the very process through which
value is determined by labour time In the Principles, Ricardo twice
returns to the divergence between current price and 'natural' price
resulting from fluctuations in supply and demand: in Chapter IV 'On

[p422]

Natural and Market Price' and in Chapter XXX 'On the Influence of
Demand and Supply on Prices'. In both chapters, in the end, he puts
aside price variations which he considers as 'accidental and temporary*
(PPET p. 111.) Marx's position on this point was very different As
early as PP he noted that 'deviations' of prices in relation to values are
not accidents but the rule And if, with Ricardo, he recognized that it
is only 'when supply and demand are evenly balanced' that 'the
relative value of any product is accurately determined by the quantity
of labour embodied in it' (PP p 52), he added immediately that this
equilibrium is never produced, that there is in fact 'no ready-made
constituted "proportional relation", but only a constituting move-
ment', and that this 'fluctuating movement' alone makes 'labour the
measure of value' (PPp 56 )[15] Clearly, the ideal situation or 'ideal
average' which we are invited to envisage under the concept of 'capital
in general' results from corrections responding automatically to dis-
crepancies existing between supply and demand; so much so that it is
just as legitimate to consider the corrections as being the effects
peculiar to competition as the discrepancies themselves The function
which competition assumes in relation to the abstraction 'capital in
general' thus becomes extremely problematic In this respect, it is
symptomatic that this extract from Capital, in which we find expressed
the crude and extremely over-simplified opposition between concept
and appearance, is immediately followed by a passage in which the
ambiguity of the role played by competition appears with full clarity
Indeed, Marx states that the constant discrepancies between supply
and demand automatically produce economic processes to compensate
them And it is precisely from the interaction of these contradictory
movements that there arises a tendency for an equilibrium situation to
be realized 'Since, therefore, supply and demand never equal one
another in any given case, their differences follow one another in such
a way—and the result of a deviation in one direction Is that it calls
forth a deviation in the opposite direction—that supply and demand
ate always equated when the whole is viewed over a certain period . . '
(Capital, III, p 190) If we follow Marx in this reasoning we are led to
invoke the supply/demand relation in order to explain two directly
opposed phenomena: on the one hand, the gap between the market

[p423]

price and market value, hence the persistent discrepancy between
reality and theoretical hypothesis, and on the other hand, the equally
persistent tendency towards the reduction of that gap, hence the close-
ness with which the theoretical abstraction accords-to reality itself
Marx comes straight out with the ambiguity of the role given to the
supply/demand relation: 'On the one hand, the relation of demand
and supply, therefore, only explains the deviations of market-prices
from market values On the other, it explains the tendency to
eliminate these deviations, i e , to eliminate the effect of the relation
of demand and supply ' (Capital, III, p 190.)
To put it more rigorously, it is therefore false to say that the effects
of competition are provisionally suspended in the analyses of Capital
If its hidden action were not in fact assumed, the state of equilibrium
to which the 'concept of capital' delates would be a pure product of the
imagination In the absence of some planning body or other, it is this
hidden action which constrains the possessors of capital to alter the
distribution of their investments in such a way that social labour is
distributed among the different branches of production in proportions
adequate to the structure of social needs This hidden action of com-
petition is the indispensable mediation for the realization of the law of
value in the sense in which Marx understood that law—an immanent
principle of organization of the productive totality The main point
had been made in this connection in Grundrisse: 'competition in
general is the crucial motor of bourgeois economy; it does not establish
its laws but it executes them In the case of the economists, to
presuppose, as Ricardo does, that unlimited competition exists, is to
presuppose the full reality and realization of bourgeois relations of
production in their specific difference Competition, therefore, does
not explain these laws; it makes them visible but it does not produce
them..' (Grundrisse, pp 649-52.) The means through which the laws
peculiar to bourgeois relations of production impose themselves are to
be found in the 'free' and individual choices made by the multiple
protagonists on the economic chess-board, all these choices being
governed by an immanent rationality which ensure their interconnec-
tion without the subjects knowing Marx attributes to competition,
and to fluctuations in supply and demand—concrete manifestations of
the specificity of the capitalist mode of production—a role which is
roughly comparable to that played by human passions in the Hegelian
conception of history They ate means in the service of a finality
unknown to themselves, but far from impeding it they help in its
design [^16]


[p424]

We were wondering earlier whether we could envisage bringing
Marx's critical work to completion by demonstrating, as he wanted to,
that the conversion of the possibility of crises into reality was inevit- •
able because of the laws governing the capitalist system of production
It seems that the answer must be negative For competition cannot
assume without contradiction the dual role assigned to it by Marx's
formulations If the automatic compensations induced by the mechan-
isms of competition impose an adjustment of capital distribution
which meets the requirements of the qualitative and quantitatrve
structure of social needs, it is impossible to introduce the fluctuations
in supply and demand as a new factor which would permit one to leave
the study of 'capital in general' in order to deal with competition For
the existence of these fluctuations has been tacitly presupposed
throughout the work on 'capital in general' The hypothesis of
equilibrium on which the formulation of the law of value or of the sale
of commodities at their costs of production rests, bars the route, then,
to a theoryof the conditions of realization of crises. There is, of course, \i
nothing to prevent the carrying out of an empirical study on this
question But the hiatus separating political economy from economic
history cannot be abolished Crises are destined to remain a contingent
phenomenon for theory.

[416n]

11 Disequilibriums correspond to economic crises, the inevitable final destructunng is.
foreshadowed in the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall and the means
with contradictory effects which the owners of capitals put to work in order to
alleviate this falling rate (increased concentration and centralization of capital)
Strictly speaking this law constitutes the law of development of the capitalist
system of production Cyclical crises and the tendency of the rate of profit to decline
are, moreover, linked (Capital, III, pp 256-7 ) But the crises can be conceived as
moments built into the regulation of the system, since in the end they restore a new
equilibrium exactly where they had allowed the collapse of the old one. The
phenomenon of the falling rate, of profit on the contrary, gives us an inkling,
according to Marx of the limits of capitalist production For the'rate of profit' and
not the production of use values, is the 'motive power of capitalist production'
(Capital, HI, p 259 ) Its fall weakens the principal driving power of accumulation,
discourages the constitution of new autonomous capitals, and appears to threaten,
at some future date the development of the productive forces (Capital HI. pp 260-
1 ) That is why, Marx claims, bourgeois economists have a genuine 'horror' when
they note this phenomenon For capitalist production here proves itself not to be the
absolute form of development of the productive forces but a transitory form which
will one day curb that development after having helped it immeasurably compared
with earlier relations of production (Capital HI, pp 241-2,260-1 )

It is perhaps surprising that dealing with the Marxian critique of political
economy we focus our attention on the theory of crises rather than on the law of the
tendency of the rate of profit to decline The reason is that we are concerned with the
interpretation of Capital put forward by Rubin Ihis interpretation has as its axis
the problem of value, so that it rarely deals with the themes of CapitalVolume HI.
The theory of crises however relates directly to a question which Rubin s interpre-
tation brings to the fore that is the tole of the hypotheses of equilibrium in the
construction of Capital— hence the place we assign it here

With respect to the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, an exhaustive
critique of Marx could not. of course avoid an interrogation of its status and of the
validity of the demonstration made about it We will content ourselves with under-
lying the following point: Marx's demonstration of the law of the tendency of the
rate of profit to fall seems to us to derive from a Ricardian conception of the theory
of value This claim is doubtless paradoxical for people who know that Ricardo

[417n continues 416n11]

proposes a quite different demonstration of the same phenomenon from that of
Mane But remember thai we are considering as a Ricardian element in Marx's
thought the conception according to which productivity of labour and its variations
is the direct and exclusive cause of the magnitude of the value of the commodity-
product and the changes it undergoes Now it is indeed this conception of the
relation labour/value that supports the Matxiaq demonstration of the falling rate of
profit, since 'the progressive tendency of the general rate of profit to fall is there-
fore ;ust an expression peculiar to the capitalist mode of production of the pro-
gressive development of the social productivity of labour' (Capital III p. 213 )
On the contrary a strict adhesion to the sociological significance of the law of value
chat is its properly Marxian significance which makes it into a law regulating the
distribution of social labour between the different branches of production deprives
of meaning any global quantification of the value (or surplus value) produced by
the totality of the branches in the course of a cycle of production That Marxian
significance consequently puts into question all attempts to estimate the quantita-
tive variations of the mass of surplus value produced as well as of the rate of profit.
This confirms what we were saying earlier namely that the Ricardian concept of
surplus value crops up precisely where Marx s thought comes up against its own
internal difficulties

12 'In order to ptove that capitalist production cannot lead to general crises, all its
conditions and distinct forms all its principles and specific features—in short
capitalist production itself—ate denied ' (TSV Hp 501 and cf TSV II p 528 )

[p418n]

13 The first chapter of *Grundrisse* shows with a great deal of clarity that Marx s re­
organization of the Ricardian theory of value was motivated by his concern to
eliminate the possibility of a Utopian interpretation of that theory an interpretation
already propounded by the partisans of labour tokens Ihe decisive point of this
critique was to show that the labour time effectively spent on the production of
commodities could in no case serve as the direct measure of values, nor, conse-
quently. as the principle of distribution of social income The 'genesis' of money—
i e the demonstration that generalization of the commodity form of the product
implies the specialization of a particular commodity in the function of general
equivalent—acquires meaning within the framework of that polemic Its realization
is sufficient to establish that the success of the act of exchange is contingent on other
factors For the existence of money dissociates the unity of exchange by barter into
two distinct acts: purchase and sale, which 'may correspond or not; they may
balance or not; they may enter into disproportion with one another They will of
course always attempt to equalize one another; but in the place of chc. earlier
immediate equality there now stands the constant movement of equalization,
which evidently presupposes constant non-equivalence It is now entirely possible
that consonance may be reached only by passing through the most extreme dis­
sonance ' (*Grundrisse* p 148.) Thus the most elementary form of crisis is given .

[421n]

14 Cf 'If supply equals demand, they cease to act and for this very reason commodi-
ties are sold at their market-values Whenever two forces operate equally in opposite
directions, they balance one another, exert no outside influence and any
phenomena taking place in these circumstances must be explained by causes other
than the effect of these two forces ' (Capital III p 189 )

[422n]

15 Marx was well aware that his position on the question of competition was different
from Ricardo's This emerges from the following remark which is taken from the
commentaries which accompany his reading of Ricardo's Principles: 'Ricardo made
an abstraction of something he considered accidental It is quite different to repre-
sent the real process in which the two aspects—what he calls the accidental move-
ment but which is the constant and real element and its law, the average relation—
appear equally important' (Cf Grundrisse p 651 and CCPE p 174 )



16 Cf our interpretation of the role of competition in relation to the laws of the
capitalist mode of production with this statement from Hcgal: 'This vast congeries

[423n continue 422n16]

of volitions interests and activities constitute the instruments and means of the
World-Spirit for attaining its object; bringing it to consciousness and realizing it
But that those manifestations of vitality on the part of individuals and peoples in
which they seek and satisfy their own purposes arc at the same time the means
and instruments of a higher and broader purpose of which they know nothing—
which they realize unconsciously—might be made a matter of question (Hegel,
Philosophy of History 1956 p 25 ) The influence that this work of Hegel s. and
perhaps even more the logic has exercised on the constitution of Capitals to this
day far from perfectly elucidated in spite of the numerous tesearch works which
the relations between Marx and Hegel have inspired The reason is that few authors
have given systematic attention to the structures of the work, save a few rare excep-
tions amongst which the most important are R Rosdolsky and H, Rerchelt
Reichelt's claim that the law of value is a sort of transcendental synthesis a unify-,
ing principle working without our knowledge at the level of social labour' (Reichelt
1970 p. 144) will make more than one Marxist who is persuaded of the materialism
of the Marxian gnoseology bristle But we subscribe to it without hesitation, for
reasons which will emerge clearly enough from our interpretation of the patticular
significance Marx attributes to the 'law of value'

## 5 Conclusion: the Limits of the Marxian Critique of Political Economy

Ihe inability of Marxist theory as presented in Capital to account for

[p425]

what Marx called the 'reality of crises' throws new light on a classic
problem of the epistemology of political economy We are talking
about the operative character of equilibrium models for the compre-
hension of the real functioning of the capitalist system of production.
Controlable mathematical models, which for the greater part of
academic political economy of the twentieth century represent the
ideal norm to which, in so far as it is 'scientific', economic theory
should tend, have often been the object of critiques, whether
emphasis is placed on the illusory character of the understanding they
propose or whether, even more radically, the ideological function they
perform is stigmatized.[^17] By offering the satisfying picture of an
economic production all the parameters of which have been mastered,
they deny the disorder constitutive of capitalist commodity produc-
tion Well before formalist scientific ideology had brought caution to
this conception of economic discourse, the nature of the problems
posed by 'bourgeois' economic doctrines had prepared the ground
which mathematical models have subsequently occupied Marx had
denounced the principle when he criticized as a characteristic sign of
the apologetic approach the fact that from the outset it assimilated
commodity production to 'social' production, so that 'society, as if
according to a plan, distributes its means of production and produc-
tive forces in the degree and measure which is required for the fulfil-
ment of the various social needs, so that each sphere of production
receives the quota of social capital required to satisfy the correspond-
ing need' (TSV II p. 529 ) In so far as he intended his approach to be
a critical one, Marx himself hoped to pose the initial question of
political economy in a different way. 'On the contrary, the question
that has to be answered is: since, on the basis of capitalist production,
everyone works for himself and a particular labour must at the same
time appear as its opposite, as abstract general labour and in this form
as social labour—how is it possible to achieve the necessary balance

17 A critique of the first type can be found in Keynes himself in connection with the
specific hypothesis of full employment; Ihe classical theorists resemble Euclidean
geometers in a non-Euclid world who discovering that in experience straight lines
apparently parallel often meet rebuke the lines for not keeping straight—as the
only remedy for the unfortunate collisions which are occurring (Keynes General
Theory 1974 p 16 ) For the second type of critique cf among others Badiou:
'Generally speaking, bourgeois political economy is accomplished in the construc-
tion of models of balanced expansion Here again, the model guards against
capitalist 'disorder not by means of an understanding of its cause (i e. the Marxist
science of social formations and its comprehension of the class struggle) but by the
integrated technical image of the bourgeoisie s class interests Models of expansion
in equilibrium objectify class objectives under cover of thinking theit object (the
economy of alleged 'industrial societies' ) ' (Badiou Le concept de modele 1969
P 16)
