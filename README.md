## [Marx and Engels works](ME.tsv)

Initial quick fix to correlate common citation keys like "Marx 1998" for Capital Vol 3 with the WorkCode and ManifestationCode used here - C3 MECW37

Codes:

Work Codes C0 to C5 are as defined for "Five Volumes of Capital" and these table will be moved to that repository later.

File linked above has Tab Separated Values table with columns for:

## [From Rob Bryer's works (recursively)](bryer.md)

Just adding items here as I come across them while making notes on "Accounting for Values" and its references to define short citation keys.

For references in my notes on Bryer to Marx and Engels I will just use combined keys in the form "M1998 C3 MECW37" in the notes. See table above. Including suffixes for chapter.section etc and page.paragraph when I lookup quotations. Paragraphs are numbered 0 when they started on previous page.
