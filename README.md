# Bibliographies

To be included in Zotero using citation keys implicitly defined here.

## [Marx and Engels works](ME.tsv)

Initial quick fix to correlate common citation keys like "Marx 1998" for Capital Vol 3 with the WorkCode and 
ManifestationCode used here - C3 MECW37

Codes:

Work Code prefixes C0 to C5 are as defined for "Five Volumes of Capital" and these tables will be moved to that repository 
later. Suffixes for chapter.section etc and page.paragraph when I lookup quotations in a manifestation. Paragraphs are 
numbered 0 when they started on previous page.

## [From Rob Bryer's works (recursively)](bryer.md)

Just adding items here as I come across them while making notes on "Accounting for Values" and its references to define
short citation keys.

For references in my notes on Bryer to Marx and Engels I will just use combined keys in the form "M1998 C3 MECW37".

See table above.
